Instructions: Please complete the following to the best of your ability. If you are unable to complete, 

consider explaining why and how you would otherwise complete it (if you run out of time). Feel free to 

ask clarifying questions.

We want you to show us how you would tackle this problem through the entire lifecycle of developing a 

control, from the design phase, to prototype, to automation tests, to documentation. 

 

Ensure that your project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Design Pattern. 

1. Using C#, Design and Prototype a custom layout control for WPF that derives from ItemsControl 

(not from Selector) and displays data items using a ‘snaking’ layout (i.e., items should be laid out 

from left to right, top to bottom).

2. The control should support typical .NET list control patterns such as single selection, list binding 

and scrolling.

3. Optional: Expose an Orientation property that determines the direction in which items will wrap 

and ItemWidth and ItemHeight properties to control the size the items.

4. Include some basic Unit Tests as well as a Test Project that uses the control.

5. Comment your code and provide /// documentation for public properties and classes.
